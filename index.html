				<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">Problem I faced:</h5>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;text-indent: 20px;"> Reading in your target language is one of the most effective ways to learn. It not only helps you acquire useful vocabulary but also teaches you the patterns and grammar of the language naturally. Compared to flashcards, reading allows you to see how words work together in context, creating meaningful connections and deepening your understanding. However, while there are paid tools for reading in your target language, simply reading without a system to track your progress isn't as effective. Manually tracking vocabulary can be tedious, you need to space out review sessions for familiar words while focusing on newly learned ones. What's needed is a solution that automates this process, saving you time and effort.</p>

			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0px;margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">My solution:</h5>
			<p style="font-size: 18px;margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;text-indent: 20px;"> I combined these two essential aspects of language learning into a single, streamlined application. With this app, you can upload any text you want to read, and the system will automatically extract all the words for your vocabulary list. As you read, you can save meanings for unfamiliar words, and the app will schedule reviews based on how well you remember each word. The more challenging a word is for you to recall, the more frequently it will appear in your reviews. This way, you can focus on enjoying the text while the app handles tracking your vocabulary and optimizing your study schedule. Simply add a text, read, and let the system guide your learning journey. </p>
